Azure Pipeline from On-Premises SQL Server to Cloud SQL Database

This project aims to create an automated data pipeline for migrating data from an on-premises SQL Server database to the cloud, specifically utilizing Azure services for efficient management and processing.

Key Components:

    Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen 2): Serves as the data lake for storing raw data.

    Azure Data Factory: Used for orchestrating and managing data workflows, ensuring seamless integration from source to destination.

    Azure Synapse Analytics: Acts as the cloud-based SQL database where processed data is stored for subsequent analysis and reporting.

    Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards and performing detailed data analysis.

    Azure Databricks: Employed for data processing and transformation tasks, ensuring data is prepared efficiently for analytics.

    Azure Key Vault and Azure Active Directory: Ensures robust security and governance measures are in place to protect sensitive data and manage access securely.

This end-to-end Azure pipeline streamlines the migration of data, ensuring reliability, scalability, and security throughout the process.
